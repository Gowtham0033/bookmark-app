# Smart Bookmark App (starter)

This workspace contains a minimal scaffold for the Smart Bookmark App assignment.

What I created:

- Minimal Next.js App Router scaffold in the `app/` directory
- Tailwind CSS configured (`tailwind.config.js`, `postcss.config.js`, and `app/globals.css`)
- Supabase client stub at `lib/supabaseClient.js` (reads from `NEXT_PUBLIC_` env vars)
- Basic `package.json` with scripts

Quick start (macOS / Linux):

```bash
cd /Users/gowthamvantakula/Downloads/Assin
npm install
npm run dev
```
